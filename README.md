# LD32_practice
Ludum Dare 32 practice repo

This repo is a practice for the Ludum Dare 32 (April, 2015), done during warmup week.

I'll be going through the HaxeFlixel dungeon crawler tutorial http://haxeflixel.com/documentation/tutorials/

I won't use any of the assets in the tutorial. Instead I'll make them from scratch myself:

Art: PyxelEdit http://pyxeledit.com/
Music: Bosca Ceoil http://distractionware.com/blog/2013/08/bosca-ceoil/
Sounds: sfxr http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html

Original project files will be saved to /develop
